# **Board game theory**
## Lesson 1 : core components

---

# Building blocks of gaming

 - RESOURCES
 - VICTORY CONDITIONS
 - PLAYER INTERACTION

---

# RESOURCES

The player has access to resources during the game.
Resources can create a sense of progression, define win conditions,
introduce strategic play and can serve many more purposes to the designer.

eg. action points, gold, cards...

There are different types of resources:

---

## Scaling resources

 - start off small, increase over time
 - <span style="color:red;">NOT STACKABLE</span>
 - <u>replenish</u> consecutively
 - create a sense of progression
 - effects of the resource scale as the resource grows
 - => gained power is psychologically rewarding
 - eg. gaining 1 total energy every turn

---

## Fixed resources

 - don't change through the game
 - <u>reset</u> consecutively
 - simple to understand
 - eg. action points ...

---

## Accumulating resources

 - stackable if saved up
 - less pressure on the player to spend them
 - decisions (by the player) involving them are complex and take into account a multitude of factors
 - => you can set a limit on how much of the resource can be kept to push the players to use them if necessary
 - eg. cards in yugi, gold

---

# PLAYER INTERACTION

During a game, the players interact with each other.

These interactions help move the game forward and generate excitement and psychological rewards.

---

## Shared resource

A resource that multiple players have access to.
A key element is that those resources can be taken by one player from another. They come in two types:

 - <span style="color:red;">hot</span>: make it very clear when a player takes something from another player, create more tension.
   eg. territory laid out on board
 - <span style="color:blue;">cold</span>: hidden are more subtle
   eg. cards in a face down deck

---

## Direct attack

 - an attempt to attack or destroy another player's resources.
 - help a game feel more interactive. But needs "balancing" to make it harder to have one single player with a runaway advantage when attacking a critical resource.


---

## Deduction

 - assessing another player for a key piece of information.
 - psychological interaction.
 - deep gameplay without many complex rules.
 - players reveal bits of information at a time and fill in the blanks as the game progresses.

---

# VICTORY CONDITIONS

To end the game, we need to define specific victory conditions.

 - the conditions set a goal for the players to plan their interactions around.

---

## Player elimination

 - simple removal of all the other players from the game.
 - better the fewer the number of players.

---

## Time limit

 - the game ends after a set amount of time or depletion of a    specific resource.
 - metrics are defined against which each player is evaluated and the best score wins.
 - introduces the sense of urgency in late game.

---

## Goal achieving

 - the game ends when a specific goal is achieved.
 - a clear direction is given to the players.
 - useful to hide how close players are to winning until the end to maintain tension.

---

# Other key elements in board game design

 - Core play loop
 - Tensions of the game

---

# CORE PLAY LOOP

The basic pattern of play at the heart of the game.
Should be easy to describe (one sentence or two)

eg. COD: loot => shoot - chess: move pieces => checkmate

---

## Defining a play loop

 - at this stage, all other components of the game are <u>loosely defined</u> and <u>flexible</u>.
 - the other components are perfected later.
 - ignore the roughness and improve the fun attributes of the loop.
 - iterate until you find a fun and engaging basic game loop.

---

# TENSIONS OF THE GAME

The goal of the designer is to put roadblocks and challenges on the players to make the game more rewarding.

These tensions are restrictions on how the player is allowed to act and interact with other players.

eg. subnautica limited oxygen and resources that spoil

There can be multiple layers of tension in a given game.

---

## Strenghtening the fundamental tension of the game

 1) identify the fundamenal tension of the game
 2) identify all tensions of the game
 3) When making a design decision, ask "Does this reinforce or weaken the fundamental tension of the game?"
