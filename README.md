# game-dev-curriculum
My attempt at self-teaching game design and development.
This curriculum is inspired by the [VFS game design curriculum](https://vfs.edu/programs/game-design/curriculum).
Some additional resources are provided [here](./additional_links.md).

This repo will be updated with every "Term" and every class I research.
I will do my best to provide examples and notes for each subject.

# Term 1

Learn the basics of a variety of game dev adjacent subjects. Materials included are public and linked.
Follow this [link](./term_1/README.md) to view the full Term description.
